Azure Data Studio (ADS) Notebooks is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing databases using TSQL, SSIS Report Server, custom TSQL functions, and stored procedures. It is preferred over using Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebooks for working with databases.

With this project, you will have access to a vast library of examples and explanations to help you master TSQL and become a proficient database programmer.

The notebooks cover a wide range of topics including:

-   TSQL Language
-   SSIS Report Server
-   Custom TSQL functions and Stored Procedures

It can be used as study guides or cheat sheets for quick reference and to improve your skills.

I will be regularly updating and releasing new and improved notebooks, so be sure to watch this project for updates.

Thanks for using ADS_Notebooks!
